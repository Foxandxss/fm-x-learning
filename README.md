# FM-X - Learning

FM-X is a FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesizer engine built-in in the Yamaha Montage and MODX.

I believe that the best way of learning how to use any synthesizer is by replicating a sound step by step, to see, or better said, hear, what changes are being applied at any step.

There is no easy way to do this with the hardware, other than manually writting down a hundred of different values and then applying them back one by one.

## What is this project?

This projects aims to be a database of patches that can be seen visually as close as possible with the hardware.

While new patches needs to be entered by hand, the interface will provide default values that will speed up the process.

Once a patch is created, a unique url will be give so a person can open the patch in the browser and use it as a guide to replicate it on their hardware.

## What is NOT this project?

This project is not a FM-X synthesizer. There is no implementation of this engine outside Montage/MODX.

This project can't apply the patches directly to the hardware like SoundMondo. It is a read only patch meant for learning.

## Technology behind this project

This project is created with [NX](https://nx.dev/) using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

It is my first React project, so this is a metalearning project of some sort :joy:

## How to use it

Still on development, so TBD
